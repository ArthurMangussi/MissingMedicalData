# Robustness Evaluation of Image Inpainting Techniques

This repository contains the codebase for the paper:

**"Towards Data-Centric AI in Mammography: Robustness Evaluation of Image Inpainting Techniques"**

## Getting Started

We recommend creating a **virtual environment** before running the experiments:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
.\env\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
```

To install the required dependencies, run:
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
